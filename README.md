# game description
this is a side game for the game Temporal light(still in development).
In this game you take the role of princess Light crystal Lightbringer, a wolf, cat, and human hybrid in a futuristic world set in 6018AD.
the universe this game takes place in is an parallel one in which magic helped technology to be advanced more than what we have now and the game takes place in the far future of that timeline.
in this game your objective is to get onto the temporal knife. an experimental ship able to traverse through multiple timelines.(it can also time travel).
however light's father cumulo "Flare" lightbringer does not want light to board at all costs. this is because her mother dissapeared 18 years prior under misterious circumstances and he does not want light to be the same.


this game does have flashing lights in certain sections of the game(epilepsy warning).
